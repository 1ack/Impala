Prerequisites
-------------
1) Boost (libbost<>-dev package)
2) Thrift source installation (unlike Java, C++ needs extra header files).
Download this from Apache, then build. Requires Boost and python<version>-dev.
3) cmake
4) Hadoop
$HADOO_HOME must be set (e.g. mine is /home/abehm/hive/build/hadoopcore/hadoop-0.20.2-cdh3u1-SNAPSHOT).
To run an exec linked against libhdfs, the CLASSPATH must include 
all jars in $HADOOP_HOME and $HADOOP_HOME/lib, 
as well as the path with hdfs-site.xml.

Building
--------
1) You first need to generate the thrift structures, which are written into be/generated-sources/gen-cpp.  To do that:
	cd impala/fe
	mvn compile

2) Run 'cmake .' from impala/be; this will generated makefiles

3) From impala/be: make
