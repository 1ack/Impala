Prerequisites

1) Boost (libbost<>-dev package)
2) Thrift source installation (unlike Java, C++ needs extra header files).

3) cmake
4) Hadoop

To run an exec linked against libhdfs, the CLASSPATH must include 
all jars in $HADOOP_HOME and $HADOOP_HOME/lib, 
as well as the path with hdfs-site.xml.

Building
--------
1) You first need to generate the thrift structures, which are written into be/generated-sources/gen-cpp.  To do that:
	cd impala/fe
	mvn compile

2) Run 'cmake .' from impala/be; this will generated makefiles

3) From impala/be: make
